The PiryxDeveloperProblem is an application that loads previous donations and,
using a command line loop to read "new" donations, executes logic to determine
if previous donators should be notified of the new donation message.

With the default configuration, the application loads previous donations from the
/resources/donors.csv file, however this loading file is configurable via the
/resources/application.properties file (key fileForFileDonorLoader)

Simplest steps to run the application are as follows:

1)  Compile files using java 1.6 or above in src directory
2)  Run the program with: "java PiryxDeveloperProblem"
3)  Type in new donations to the command prompt (/resources/testcases.txt has some examples)
4)  Read output to see notification behavior
5)  Type 'quit' to exit from run loop
